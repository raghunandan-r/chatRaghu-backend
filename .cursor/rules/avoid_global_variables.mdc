Limit the use of global variables.
- Prefer passing data as function arguments or returning values.
- Use class attributes or instance variables for state within objects.
- If global configuration is necessary, use a structured configuration management approach (e.g., Pydantic settings, environment variables) rather than mutable global variables.
- Ensure variables have the narrowest possible scope.
