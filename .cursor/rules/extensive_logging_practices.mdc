Implement comprehensive logging for all new flows, control paths, and significant operations.
- Use Python's standard `logging` module.
- Configure loggers with appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
- Include relevant variables and context in log messages to aid debugging.
- Log successful operations, important state changes, and all error conditions.
- Avoid logging sensitive user data unless strictly necessary and properly redacted.
- Ensure logs are structured (e.g., JSON format) if the project uses a log aggregation system.
- Log entry and exit points for key functions/methods.
