description: Implement robust and graceful exception handling using try-except blocks.

All code must implement graceful exception handling using `try-except` blocks.
- Catch specific exception types rather than broad `Exception` where possible.
- Provide meaningful error messages for caught exceptions.
- Log the exception details (traceback, error message) for debugging.
- Avoid "bare except" clauses; at minimum, catch `Exception` and log it.
- Re-raise exceptions if they cannot be fully handled at the current level, or if downstream components need to process them.
- Differentiate between expected and unexpected errors.
