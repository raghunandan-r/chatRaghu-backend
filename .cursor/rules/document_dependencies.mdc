Whenever a new Python package is introduced or an existing one's version is changed, its exact version must be added or updated in `requirements.txt`.
- Pin dependency versions (e.g., `package==1.2.3`).
- Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to generate an updated list, then manually review and prune.
- If proposing new code that requires a dependency, explicitly state it needs to be added to `requirements.txt`.
