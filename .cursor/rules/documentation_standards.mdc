All significant changes require well-documented changes.
- For new features or major changes, propose a brief technical specification (tech spec) or Architectural Decision Record (ADR) outlining the approach.
- Commit messages should be clear, concise, and follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- Document functions and classes with comprehensive docstrings explaining purpose, arguments, and returns (as per PEP 8).
