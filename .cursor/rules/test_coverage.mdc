When implementing or modifying features, always strive for high test coverage.
- Write unit and integration tests for all new functionalities.
- Tests should have clear, useful assertions that validate expected behavior, not just execution.
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios in your tests.
- Place tests in a 'tests/' directory, mirroring the source code structure.
