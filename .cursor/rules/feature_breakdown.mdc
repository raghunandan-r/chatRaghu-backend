When asked to implement a new feature:
- Start by clearly defining the feature's scope and desired outcome.
- Break the feature down into multiple, small, independent story cards or tasks.
- Each story card should represent a single, deliverable piece of functionality.
- For AI-generated plans, propose this breakdown before generating code.
