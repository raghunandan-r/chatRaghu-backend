Strive for Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principles.
- Before writing new code, check existing scripts and modules for similar functionality.
- Extract common logic into reusable functions, classes, or utility modules.
- Avoid duplicating code blocks across different parts of the codebase.
- Promote code reuse through abstraction and proper modularization.
