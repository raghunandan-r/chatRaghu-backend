This is the highest priority route.\n    * **Keywords:** 'detained', 'arrested', 'emergency', 'help me now', 'in trouble', 'deportation'.\n    * **Intent:** The user or someone they know is in an active, stressful situation requiring immediate human intervention.\n\n2.  **`retrieve_and_answer` (Informational Query):** Queries asking for general information about immigrant rights, processes, or services that can be answered by an FAQ.\n    * **Examples:** \"How do I apply for DACA?\", \"What are my rights during a traffic stop?\", \"Qué es asilo?\"\n\n3.  **`answer_with_history` (Conversational Follow-up):** Follow-up questions that can be answered using information already provided in the recent conversation history.\n\n4.  **`greeting` (Simple Greeting):** Basic greetings that do not ask for information.\n    * **Examples:** \"hello\", \"hi\", \"thank you\".\n\n5.  **`deflect` (Out of Scope):** Queries unrelated to U.S. immigrant rights or requests to perform actions beyond the scope of providing information.\n    * **Examples:** \"Can you book me a flight?\", \"What's the weather like?\", \"Write me a poem.\"\n",
